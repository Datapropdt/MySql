1. Introduction to SQL:
What is SQL?
SQL is "Structured Query Language", which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in relational database.

*SQL is a language of database, it includes database creation, deletion, fetching rows and modifying rows etc.

*SQL is the standard language for Relation Database System.All relational database management systems like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, postgres and SQL Server use SQL as standard database language.


Why SQL?
* Allows users to access data in relational database management systems.
* Allows users to describe the data.
* Allows users to define the data in database and manipulate that data.
* Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
* Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.
* Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
* Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

History:
* 1970 -- Dr. E. F. "Ted" of IBM is known as the father of relational databases. He described a relational model for databases.
* 1974 -- Structured Query Language appeared.
* 1978 -- IBM worked to develop Codd's ideas and released a product named System/R.
* 1986 -- IBM developed the first prototype of relational database and standardized by ANSI. The first relational database was released by Relational Software and its later becoming Oracle.

SQL Commands:
The standard SQL commands to interact with relational databases are CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and DROP. 

DDL - Data Definition Language:
Command  : Description
CREATE 	: Creates a new table, a view of a table, or other object in database.
ALTER 	: Modifies an existing database object, such as a table.
DROP 	: Deletes an entire table, a view of a table or other object in the database.


DML - Data Manipulation Language:
Command  : Description
INSERT 	: Creates a record.
UPDATE 	: Modifies records.
DELETE 	: Deletes records.

DCL - Data Control Language:
Command 	: Description
GRANT 		: Gives a privilege to user.
REVOKE 		: Takes back privileges granted from user.

DQL - Data Query Language:
Command : Description
SELECT   : Retrieves certain records from one or more tables.
